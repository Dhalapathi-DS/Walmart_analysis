Key techniques include EDA, outlier detection, and confidence interval estimation based on the Central Limit Theorem. Insights help identify significant trends in spending habits to optimize marketing and business strategies. Tools used include Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy.
